# Eatup

Eatup is a way for people who want to eat lunch and meet new people at the same time. 
It's a meetup to eat (hence, Eat Up).

##How It Works   
People confirm that they are available to go on a lunch date around 11:45. 
By noon, they are paired up with someone else who wants to eat lunch and has similar interests than them.
Once paired, they are given restaurant choices and a chat box so that they can talk about their lunch date.
After some time has passed, users can say whether their lunch date was a success, not a success, or a no show.
